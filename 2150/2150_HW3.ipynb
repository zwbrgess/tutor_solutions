    "evaluation? Here’s a nice algorithm based on stacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, divide the expression into tokens. Each token is an operand, operator, or parentheses symbol.\n",
    "2. Maintain two stacks. One keeps track of operands, and the other keeps track of operators/parentheses. Initially, both stacks are empty.\n",
    "3. For each token, T, in the expression:\n",
    "• If T is an operand, push T onto the operand stack.\n",
    "• If T is an operator:\n",
    "– Pop the operator stack until it becomes empty, or until T’s precedence becomes\n",
    "greater than the precedence of the operator on top of the operator stack.1\n",
    "– Push T onto the operator stack.\n",
    "• If T is an open parentheses, push T onto the operator stack with the lowest possible\n",
    "precedence (even lower than addition/subtraction).\n",
    "• If T is a close parentheses, pop the operator stack until an open parentheses is found.\n",
    "Pop the open parentheses itself as well.\n",
    "4. Pop all remaining operators from the operator stack.\n",
    "5. In steps 3-4 above: Every time a non-parentheses operator is popped from the operator\n",
    "stack, also pop the top two operands from the operand stack, perform the indicated operation, and push the result back onto the operand stack. Note that the first operand\n",
    "popped should be the second operand in the operation. For example, suppose the top\n",
    "element of the operand stack is 10 and the next element is 8, and a − operator is popped\n",
    "from the operator stack. Then the operation 8 − 10 should be performed, and the result\n",
    "of −2 pushed onto the operand stack.\n",
